# AI Assistant - Ava

Ava is a basic AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It allows you to perform various tasks by speaking to it.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Ava AI assistant, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` library
- `pyttsx3` library
- `openai` library
- `webbrowser` library

You will also need an OpenAI API key, which you can get from the OpenAI website.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Obtain an OpenAI API key and replace `apikey` in `config.py` with your actual API key.

## How to Use

To interact with Ava, run the `ava.py` script in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
$ python ava.py
```

Once the script is running, you can speak to Ava, and it will respond accordingly. Ava can do the following tasks:

- Open websites: Just say "Open [website name]" to open the desired website in your default web browser.
- Play Music: Say "Open music" and then tell Ava the name of the song you want to play.
- Check Time: Say "What is the time" or "Tell me the time" to know the current time.
- Open Applications: You can ask Ava to open applications by saying "Open [application name]."
- Use Artificial Intelligence: If you say "Using artificial intelligence" in your query, Ava will use GPT-3.5 to provide a response to your prompt.
- Exit: To exit Ava, say "Bye."
